# This Repository is a recording of my collage study
- LCD1602 module is totally followed the datasheet of HD44780, nothing to care about.

- LCD12864 module is followes the datasheet of KS0108,which is rarely being seen nowaday.The things you need to pay a attention to is that KS0108 has no CGROM, you need to write everything you need to show in the RAM. When you want to show Chinese characters make sure the **coding** of chinese character is **UTF-8** .
When you setup the data you want to show in *font.h* , all you need to do is call the integrated program,and write the character you want to show dircetly.
